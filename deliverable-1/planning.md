# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document will evolve throughout your project. You commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Specify if you have a partner and who they are.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app, browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the partner or the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how and how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools to be used or being considered. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?

## Intellectual Property Confidentiality Agreement 
> Note this section is **not marked** but must be completed briefly if you have a partner. If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza.
>  
**By default, you own any work that you do as part of your coursework.** However, some partners may want you to keep the project confidential after the course is complete. As part of your first deliverable, you should discuss and agree upon an option with your partner. Examples include:
1. You can share the software and the code freely with anyone with or without a license, regardless of domain, for any use.
2. You can upload the code to GitHub or other similar publicly available domains.
3. You will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual. 
4. You will share the code under an open-source license and distribute it as you wish but only the partner can access the system deployed during the course.
5. You will only reference the work you did in your resume, interviews, etc. You agree to not share the code or software in any capacity with anyone unless your partner has agreed to it.

**Your partner cannot ask you to sign any legal agreements or documents pertaining to non-disclosure, confidentiality, IP ownership, etc.**

Briefly describe which option you have agreed to.

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * Why did you choose them to take that role? Specify if they are interested in learning that part, experienced in it, or any other reasons. Do no make things up. This part is not graded but may be reviewed later.


#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
