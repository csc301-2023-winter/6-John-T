# Group 6: EXgoblins
​
> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 
​
## Description 
Keep this section very brief.
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve? Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
​
## Key Features
 * Describe the key features in the application that the user can access.
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature.
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built
​
## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
 To access the project, first, either go to https://6-john-t-one.vercel.app/#/. When prompted, grant the webpage access to your phone camera. Then, use your phone camera to scan one of the QR codes given. Alternatively, you can scan a QR code straight from your camera without going to the website above. \
 Doing either of the steps above will bring you to the corresponding media page where you can listen to a small meditative audio clip. You can rewind or fast forward 10 seconds by clicking the corresponding buttons. \
 To scan another QR code, either go back to https://6-john-t-one.vercel.app/#/ or open your phone camera app, and scan another QR code.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!
​
 ## Licenses 
​
 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​
 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
